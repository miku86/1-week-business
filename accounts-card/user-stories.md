### MVP

- As a new user, I can see a list of empty boxes for a lot of websites (Facebook, Linkedin, Instagram etc.).
- As a new user, I can add my account name/handle to every box.
- As a new user, I can click on a "create card"-button to create a customizable accounts card.
- As a new user, I can select accounts I want to share.
- As a new user, I can get the shareable link to this created card.
- As a new user, I can visit the accounts card when I input the created cards URL.

### Ideas
