## General Learnings

- always use hashtags (on twitter): if you don't have many followers, new people only see you through your followers' likes and retweets. Because most people follow many accounts and are not online all the time, your window of opportunity (= attention) is really small! If you use hashtags, people who are currently online can see your tweets more easily (without the need to be connected to your original followers) and can like and retweet it.

#### Learnings / Ideas

- show explanations (Explain it like I'm 5) about the product tightly coupled to the product (e.g. on the site)
- make it VERY easy for the user to start, e.g. 1-click demo account instead of letting the user type in demo account data
- add the twitter thread to the launch post, maybe some folks are interested in it?
- getting started using the product should be as frictionless as possible for the users
- users are smart and test a lot of edge cases for you

#### Learnings / Ideas

- note: these key points are my personal interpretations of conversations on twitter, not necessarily primary quotes

- on feedback if pre product-market fit:

  - direct conversations with users ([@sarahhum](https://twitter.com/sarahhum))
  - 1. email or call 10-15 users, 2. note down feedback and pain points, 3. improve product ([@farez](https://twitter.com/farez))
  - conversations with customers, note what they say, see a pattern between customers ([@alexsideris\_](https://twitter.com/alexsideris_))
  - getting first users to email/call: start with people you know or communities you're part of (e.g. forums, slack groups) ([@farez](https://twitter.com/farez))
  - conversations, ask questions and gather up a lot of feedback. Then start working out action items for each. Then cross match the items and see if there is a theme across all the feedback ([@jamesmkenny](https://twitter.com/jamesmkenny))

- on notifying feedback creators:

  - notifying via the original source is nice, but not super practical at scale, email works pretty well ([@sarahhum](https://twitter.com/sarahhum))
  - let them know, if you implement something based on their feedback ([@alexsideris\_](https://twitter.com/alexsideris_))
  - send them back a note to thank them, show what it resulted in. Or even get back to them before execution to keep the conversation going ([@jamesmkenny](https://twitter.com/jamesmkenny))

- on user feedback boards:

  - feedback solutions are helpful at scale, when feedback gets hard to manage ([@sarahhum](https://twitter.com/sarahhum))
  - if people don't use feedback board: gentle push by letting them know, that the board exists. Or add their feedback manually ([@sarahhum](https://twitter.com/sarahhum))
  - some feedback solutions can use existing user accounts, so no signin needed ([@sarahhum](https://twitter.com/sarahhum))
  - some solutions have integrations to sync states between feedback board and team board ([@sarahhum](https://twitter.com/sarahhum))
