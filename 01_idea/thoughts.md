# Idea - Thoughts

Source: https://makebook.io/

- own problems, daily challenges
- easier by using tech?
- solve lots of peoples' problems in return for money
- your problem might be just everyone else's (validate it!)
- nomadlist grew by using (hidden) community, validation by other users who had the same problem

- immediately(!) greatest expert at your own problem and you need to know a lot about the problem
- once your solution has traction, you can collect users feedback and collected data, but only after gaining traction
- try to keep your connection to the problem alive, bad example of rich rapper, who lost connection to his audience (ghetto, poor etc.)

- start from the problem, not the solution, don't create a "problem" to legitimate a solution (because I want to code)
- example: don't create a location app if you don't want to know this => use it where it is useful, e.g. Tinder is useless without location

- start small, go micro-niche: booking software for hairdressers for african hair
- from micro-niche to multi-niche: african hair + asian hair
- from multi-niche to vertical integration: hair dressers also need a payment platform, so you go into a field your current customers also use

- keep track of all ideas: concepts => promising => building => success/failure => (post mortem)
- idea doesn't have to be earth-shattering
- share your ideas to get outside of your comfort zone and let you idea evolve, not love for the idea, also optimism bias
- you need constant feedback all the time to see what people want

- ideas: get it yourself, talk to users to evolve the idea, test asap on the market (build => launch), because the user is the validation

- collaborations dangerous, it should only be about the users
