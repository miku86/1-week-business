# Launch - Thoughts

Source: https://makebook.io/

- most important step
- wrong launch can mean failure on day one
- you want to bring in people quickly, so they use it and you get feedback
- launch as fast as possible
- Q: is it launch-ready?
- tweet after the launch about it
- be humble and nice
- answer questions
- do not buy or ask friends for upvotes/likes, you want to get honest feedback
- tell your story
- some press coverage (probably not so important anymore and I don't care)
- don't do 1 launch, keep launching
- make every feature a launch opportunity
- if your app doesn't motivate you, sell it or kill it
- how many ideas simultaneously: not all eggs in one basket, but I think not to much either, quick iterative sprints, low amount of focused(!) projects

## Technical

- fix important bugs
- add an email box: no "sign up to my shitty newsletter", instead "what would be useful for the user?" => "Know first about new updates!" => critical, because most sites lose most of the launch-day visitors
- use push notifications (gently)
- use analytics: you want to know how many people use the app, where they come from etc.
- add a feedback box: very easy to get user feedback: olark, intercom,

## Where to launch

- launch where your customers are
- Product Hunt: early adopters, indie makers, supportive, only one submit, timing important
- HackerNews: hardcore tech, honest, painful,
- Reddit: more mainstream
