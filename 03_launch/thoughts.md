# Launch - Thoughts

Sources: https://makebook.io/, https://github.com/LisaDziuba/Marketing-for-Engineers

- most important step
- wrong launch can mean failure on day one
- you want to bring in people quickly, so they use it and you get feedback
- launch as fast as possible
- Q: is it launch-ready?
- tweet after the launch about it
- be humble and nice
- answer questions
- do not buy or ask friends for upvotes/likes, you want to get honest feedback
- tell your story
- some press coverage (probably not so important anymore and I don't care)
- don't do 1 launch, keep launching
- make every feature a launch opportunity
- if your app doesn't motivate you, sell it or kill it
- how many ideas simultaneously: not all eggs in one basket, but I think not to much either, quick iterative sprints, low amount of focused(!) projects

## Technical

- fix important bugs
- add an email box: no "sign up to my shitty newsletter", instead "what would be useful for the user?" => "Know first about new updates!" => critical, because most sites lose most of the launch-day visitors
- use push notifications (gently)
- use analytics: you want to know how many people use the app, where they come from etc.
- add a feedback box: very easy to get user feedback: olark, intercom,

## Where to launch

- launch where your customers are
- Product Hunt: early adopters, indie makers, supportive, only one submit, timing important
- HackerNews: hardcore tech, honest, painful,
- Reddit: more mainstream

## Product Hunt (but also general stuff)

- Title: Name of app, for normal users, not tech-geeks
- 1st Link: Product
- Tagline: what product does, the value it provides, how would users search for it?
- Thumbnail: simple gif, square format
- gallery: some impressions, 2:1 ratio
- description: 1-2 sentences
- topics: 3-4 topics
- first comment: 3-4 sentences, introduce yourself, create a narrative that makes people relate and want to help you, e.g. if youâ€™re a 16 year-old launching your first product and answering questions in the middle of math class.
- social links: how to connect with you
- schedule: as early as possible in PST US time, ~9-11 europe
- ASK FOR FEEDBACK, respond to all comments
- be nice, don't be a douche, it's not about you, only your product
- publish your launch on social media
