# Build - Thoughts

- the faster you get your product out, the faster you get feedback (if and how they use it)
- tools to build fast and minimal exist
- downsides: probably more bugs, less testing, less maintenance => trade-offs
- avoid inaction due to perfection (10 meetings, bike-shedding(law of triviality))
- users love to play around with new features (sure?)
- perfect what needs to be perfected now
- BUT: don't make shitty products, users have to be able to use it!
- minimum needs to be minimum good
- I like the Earliest Testable/Usable/Lovable Product: https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp
- Do It Yourself in the beginning can be faster ("I know the problem and I can fix it" vs. "I know the problem, I have to tell it to someone, who's probably busy, then I have to wait for the fix")
- if you already have the skills, you don't need a team or money
- DIY => validate => repeat => if it works, monetize => hire/invest
- VC could lead to skipping validation and a solid business model (because you have VC money)
- keep your costs down, because you have to earn it later
- learn to code (good, not excellent, because time)
- use the tools you already know => trade-offs
- people discussing nitty-gritty details don't ship
- if possible, use a boring, battle-tested stack (LAMP, RoR etc.)
- discussing tools: busy vs. productive (illusion that you ship)
- don't search for the perfect tool (doesn't exist), use the one that solves the problem
- learn on-demand (the bit you need now)
- use a search engine (sounds corny, but important!)
- build for mobile and web, e.g. React Native Web (you only need one codebase)
- exception: app that is probably useless on one type, e.g. you probably don't use your bike ride tracking app at home, only on smartphone
- no money: you keep your costs low, don't get the VC disadvantages
- no office: lower costs, no commute, bigger pool of talent
- no coding skills: a lot of "no-code"-tools out there
- no connections: fly under the radar, more indie
- landing pages: explain your product, call to action squarespace, carrd, tilda, wix, wordpress, ghost.
- user data entry: typeform, google forms.
- processing data: zapier.
- contacting users: mailchimp, twilio.
- making tasks: trello.
- charging users: stripe, paypal.
- there are a lot of APIs to build business on top of => trade-offs
